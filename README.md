# Escape the Abyss
An un-winnable, not-very-fun minigame, built in HTML canvas with JavaScript objects.

## Directions
* Control your player with the up, down, left, right arrow keys
* Don't come into contact with the Abyss (it's the ball that's coming right at you)
* Everytime you move, the Abyss grows
* Last as long as you can!
